        <h2>Tips for EA FC Mobile</h2>
        
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Trying to improve at EA FC Mobile? Want to know how to get started, what to look out for, and how to become the best EA FC Mobile player? Then read along as we give you the best EA FC Mobile tips.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Play EA FC Mobile Live Events</h3>
            <p>Live events are an excellent way to upgrade your squad. There are several solid events throughout the year, some of which you might recognize from EA FC 24. Promotions like EA FC Mobile Team of the Season, Team of the Year, Centurions, Heroes, UCL Road to the Final, and more.</p>
            <p>We recommend checking them out on a weekly basis, to see if any of the new promotions went live in-game.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <h3>EA FC Mobile Quests and Daily Logins</h3>
            <p>Another great way to improve your squad is by logging in daily. That way you earn daily rewards for doing absolutely nothing - except for starting up EA FC Mobile, of course! We also recommend doing your quests, as these will give you free gems and EA FC Mobile coins which you can use to upgrade your squad further.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Adjust Your EA FC Mobile Settings</h3>
            <p>Settings can make or break your game, and while the impact isn't as big as it is with the regular EA FC 24, these settings in EA FC Mobile can make a difference.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Ultra, lower if you have an older phone or tablet. Adjust according to how the game feels. For the most competitive, we recommend medium.</li>
                <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> High</li>
                <li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> High</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Effects:</strong> Low</li>
                <li><strong>Crowd:</strong> Low or Medium (Low for competitive)</li>
                <li><strong>UI Effects:</strong> Low or Medium (Low for competitive)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Level Up Your Players</h3>
            <p>In EA FC Mobile, you can level up a player by combining two cards of the same player. This will upgrade their stats and their training volume. One upgrade will allow you to train a player not five, but ten times. Meaning that upgrading a player not only benefits you directly but also indirectly through extra training possibilities. We believe this is one of the best ways to get better players on a budget.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <h3>EA FC Mobile Exchanges</h3>
            <p>Exchanges are similar to SBCs in EA FC 24, where you can trade in excess players in your squad for new cards. These cards are often among the best, and above all, a very low effort and budget-friendly way to upgrade your squad. So try to do these every time you have a large excess of cards you do not use.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Pick the Right EA FC Mobile Skill Moves</h3>
            <p>In the Team Editor, next to formations and roles, you can pick Skill Moves. We recommend at least the Scissor and Rainbow Flick. We feel like these are currently the best Skill Moves to choose in EA FC Mobile.</p>
